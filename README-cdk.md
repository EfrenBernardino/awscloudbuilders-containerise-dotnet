# Welcome to your CDK C# project!

This is a blank project for C# development with CDK.

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

It uses the [.NET Core CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/articles/core/) to compile and execute your project.

* `cdk deploy`                                  deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
* `cdk diff`                                    compare deployed stack with current state
* `cdk synth`                                   emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
